actor User
participant "Device 1" as Device1
participant "Device 2" as Device2

Device1 -> AppServer: OAuth flow
AppServer -> PostgresDB: Create user + session 1
AppServer --> Device1: Set session cookie
Device1 --> User: Authenticated

== Sign In on Device 2 (Same User) ==
User -> Device2: Sign in with same OAuth account
Device2 -> AppServer: OAuth flow
AppServer -> PostgresDB: Find existing user + create session 2
AppServer --> Device2: Set session cookie
Device2 --> User: Authenticated

User -> Device1: Access app
Device1 -> AppServer: Request with session 1
AppServer -> PostgresDB: Validate session 1
AppServer --> Device1: Authorized content

User -> Device2: Access app
Device2 -> AppServer: Request with session 2
AppServer -> PostgresDB: Validate session 2
AppServer --> Device2: Authorized content
