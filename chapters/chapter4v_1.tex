\chapter[Sprint II]{Study and Implementation of Sprint II: Authentication \& Landing Page}


\section{Introduction}
This chapter presents the study and implementation of Sprint II, which focuses on developing the authentication system and landing page for our application. The sprint encompasses the integration of modern authentication mechanisms using NextAuth.js and database management with Prisma, along with the creation of an intuitive landing page that serves as the entry point for users. This sprint builds upon the foundation established in previous iterations and introduces essential user management capabilities that form the backbone of the application's security architecture.

\section{Technologies and Tools Used}

\subsection{NextAuth.js}
NextAuth.js is a comprehensive authentication library designed specifically for Next.js applications. It provides a complete authentication solution with support for multiple OAuth providers, database adapters, and session management strategies. The library offers built-in security features including CSRF protection, JWT tokens, and secure cookie handling. NextAuth.js simplifies the implementation of authentication flows while maintaining high security standards and providing flexibility for customization.

\subsection{Prisma}
Prisma is a next-generation Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that provides type-safe database access for Node.js applications. It offers a declarative schema definition language, automatic migration generation, and a powerful query engine. Prisma's integration with TypeScript ensures compile-time type safety and excellent developer experience through auto-completion and IntelliSense. The tool supports multiple database providers and simplifies complex database operations while maintaining optimal performance.

\section{Retrospective of Sprint II}

Sprint II successfully delivered all planned authentication features and the landing page implementation. The team effectively integrated NextAuth.js with OAuth providers, establishing a robust authentication foundation. Key achievements include seamless Google and GitHub authentication, persistent cross-device sessions, and an engaging landing page. Challenges encountered included OAuth configuration complexities and session management across different environments, which were resolved through thorough testing and documentation review. The sprint demonstrated strong collaboration between frontend and backend development, resulting in a cohesive user experience.

\section{Conclusion}

Sprint II established the essential authentication infrastructure and user entry point for the application. The successful implementation of OAuth-based authentication using NextAuth.js, combined with Prisma's database management capabilities, provides a secure and scalable foundation for user management. The responsive landing page effectively communicates the application's value proposition while guiding users toward engagement. These achievements position the project well for subsequent sprints, with a solid authentication system that supports the application's security requirements and user experience goals.
